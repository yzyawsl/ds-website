      <p>
        This page offers a short tour of what I am building in DS4200 and why.
        I am interested in principles that make visualizations trustworthy and
        readable: choosing encodings that align with the data type, using
        consistent scales, providing accessible legends, and avoiding
        unnecessary 3D or decorative clutter. I document design decisions and
        trade‑offs, including scale choices (linear/log/time), binning, and
        how to annotate key events on a time‑series. Each project aims to be
        small, polished, and replicable.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the current homework, I implement three foundational charts in D3:
        a box plot for distributions, a grouped bar chart for multi‑category
        comparison, and a smoothed line for temporal trends. These building
        blocks support many real‑world dashboards. My process emphasizes data
        cleaning, semantic HTML, and CSS that respects contrast and spacing.
      </p>

      <h2>What I’m Practicing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Clear axis labels and tick formatting</li>
        <li>Meaningful legends and annotations</li>
        <li>Layout and spacing that guides reading order</li>
        <li>Deployment via GitHub Pages for reproducibility</li>
      </ul>
